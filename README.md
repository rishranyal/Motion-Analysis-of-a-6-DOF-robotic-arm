This study explores the motion analysis and forward kinematics of the Braccio robotic arm, a
 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) system, using advanced simulation and computational tools.
 
 The project began with the physical assembly of the robotic arm, focusing on the structural and
 functional understanding of its components. Following this, a digital replica of the arm was
 created by meticulously modelling each part in the MSC Adams software, a robust platform for
 dynamic simulation of mechanical systems.
 
 In MSC Adams, the individual components of the Braccio arm were assembled into a complete
 model, enabling the analysis of its motion. This included evaluating joint behaviour, range of
 motion, and overall system dynamics. The motion analysis provided insights into the interplay
 between the robotic armâ€™s structural design and its operational efficiency, highlighting any
 constraints or optimisation opportunities.
 
 Further, the forward kinematics of the robotic arm was calculated using MATLAB. This involved
 deriving mathematical models to determine the position and orientation of the end effector based
 on joint angles. The kinematic equations were validated through simulation results, ensuring
 accuracy in predicting the arm's spatial movements.

 The integration of MSC Adams for dynamic simulation and MATLAB for kinematic
 computation provided a comprehensive framework for analysing the Braccio robotic arm. The
 study not only reinforces the applicability of these tools for robotics research but also lays the
 groundwork for future enhancements in precision and control.
 Overall, this project demonstrates the effective utilisation of software and mathematical
 modelling to bridge the gap between theoretical robotics and practical implementation,
 contributing valuable insights into the design and performance evaluation of multi-DOF robotic
 systems.
